## 🔹 Headings
**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  
- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  
- `##` for each day or major topic.  
- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

✅ Example:
# My Coding Notebook
## Day 1
### Notes
### Practice

🔡 Text Formatting
When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.
Use bold for key terms or definitions.
Use italic for emphasis or side comments.
Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

---

✅ Example:
**Class** = a blueprint for objects  
*Remember:* always test your code  
Use `System.out.println()` to print

---
 
💻 Code Blocks
When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.
Inline code for short snippets.
Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

✅ Example:
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

---

🧾 Lists
When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.
Numbered lists for sequences or steps.
Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

✅ Example:
1. Define the class
2. Write the main method
3. Test your program

Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals

---

✅ Checklists
When to use: Track progress on assignments or tasks.

✅ Example:
[x] Complete coding warm-up
- [ ] Finish project draft
- [ ] Reflect on learning

---

➡️ Blockquotes
When to use: Call out notes, reminders, or teacher comments.

✅ Example:
> 💡 Remember: Loops repeat code until a condition is false.

---

📊 Tables
When to use: Compare values, track progress, or organize data neatly.

✅ Example:

| Task        | Status   | Notes          |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Homework 1  | Done ✅  | Submitted      |
| Homework 2  | Pending  | Needs review   |

---

🔗 Links & Images
When to use: Add references, resources, or visuals.

✅ Example:
[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)  
![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)

---
 
📂 Collapsible Sections
When to use: Hide solutions, extended notes, or extra details.

✅ Example:
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
System.out.println("Answer: 42");
</details>

---
 
📝 Footnotes
When to use: Add references or side notes without cluttering the page.

✅ Example:
This concept is related to object-oriented programming.[^1]
[^1]: See "Objects and Classes" in your textbook.

🎯 Style Rules:
1. Consistency matters more than creativity
2. Always use headings to structure your notes.
3. Always use code blocks for multi-line code.
4. Clarity first
5. Bold key terms.
6. Use lists instead of long sentences when outlining steps.
7. Professional tone
8. Don’t mix casual notes with formal work in the same section.
9. Use blockquotes for reflections or teacher feedback.
10. Track your learning
11. Use checklists to mark what’s done.
12. Use collapsible sections if you want to hide answers until review time.

---
 
✅ Bottom Line:
Headings = Structure
Bold/Italic = Emphasis
Code blocks = Code
Lists = Steps/Ideas
Tables = Organization
Checklists = Progress
Blockquotes = Notes/Tips
Collapsible = Hide/Show detail
Keep it simple, consistent, and clear.
