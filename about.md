# About Me
Hello! I am Daniela.
I have a keen interest in biology, especially in understanding how living organisms function and interact with their environment. 
I am particularly fascinated by genetics, human anatomy, and ecosystems. 
My skills include scientific research, analyzing biological data, and clearly explaining complex ideas. 
One of my main goals is to deepen my knowledge of molecular biology and contribute to advances in medical science, such as developing treatments for genetic disorders or studying the spread of disease.

## Lifestyle Research:
In 10 years, I see myself living in Nevada in a modest but comfortable home with my family, driving a 2024 Toyota Venza LE and living a balanced lifestyle. My estimated monthly expenses, including housing, transportation, groceries, insurance, and savings, total around $1,900, or $22,800 annually. To comfortably support this lifestyle, I would need a gross annual salary of about $28,500. I plan to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Biology, which may cost between $40,000–$200,000 depending on the school and scholarships, and possibly pursue further education depending on my career path. My top career choice is Wildlife Biologist, as I’m passionate about animals, conservation, and working outdoors to protect natural ecosystems. Other careers that align with my interests and degree include Biological Technician, Genetic Counselor, and Clinical Informatics Specialist, each offering competitive salaries and unique opportunities. The skills I’ve gained from this course — including communication, teamwork, data analysis, and project management — will support my success in any of these roles. Ultimately, I aim for a career that allows me to live comfortably, contribute to meaningful work, and continue learning and growing in the field of biology.
